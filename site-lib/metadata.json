They discuss height differences and thought- versus leg-powered locomotion with a juxtaposition of skepticism and enthusiasm. Penelope mentioned <a data-href=\"Steel Jack\" href=\"Steel Jack\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Steel Jack</a>, a mentor she'd had. They see a wide open plain ahead of them with two trees among the emptiness where a forest used to be.<img alt=\"twin trees.PNG\" src=\"images/twin-trees.png\" target=\"_self\">They notice a vortex of leaves ahead around <a data-href=\"Elwing\" href=\"player-characters/elwing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Elwing</a>. Penelope greets him, and he gives curt replies. Penelope reveals that she's here because of a dream. Elwing is too, sort of. Gerda indicates that she, too, has had a dream, but recoils at Penelope's enthusiasm. Given what they share in common, Penelope comments on the group being a \"Dream Team.\"The wind picks up, and some dark clouds start rolling in, indicating rain within the hour. They see a collection of abandoned, ruined homes off ahead, on the way toward the twin trees. Gerda starts toward the collection of shelters, signaling to the others that they could join. Gerda\n\"Do you want to get wet?\"\nPenelope gives Elwing the nickname \"Red,\" when he declines to give his name.\nRain begins, which Penelope has never seen before, to Gerda's astonishment.<br>\nAs they continue, Gerda gathers kindling. Elwing notices that the closer they get to the houses, the cooler the air has gotten.There are rifts in the ground, so dark and deep that the bottom can't be seen. A strange noise emits from the manor, separate from the creaky gate swinging in the wind. It sounds like it could have been chattering voices, turning into a wailing scream, which fades into the chattering, followed by a wailing scream again.<img alt=\"friend manor exterior.jpg\" src=\"images/friend-manor-exterior.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Red and Penelope are concerned, but Gerda is unbothered. When she sees how earnestly concerned Penelope is about the sound, however, she pauses. As they make their way around the manor and hear the wail again.Elwing tells the others that he's going to find the source of the sound, but that he won't be taking care of them if they follow.Inside, there are piles of skin, dead bodies in various states of decomposition, brooms, junk, equipment. It's messy, but there is intent in the organization.A tall figure in the darkness of the barn emerges, swinging a tube on a string, which makes the wailing noise they had been hearing. The creature's other three arms are waving frantically.Elwing speaks to the creature in Sylvan, asking who they are. It replies in an insectoid clicking sound, saying telepathically \"Friend, Friend.\"Friend\n\"Hello, hello. Do you like music?\"\nIts three arms continue waving hard, expressing a fervent greeting, as it swings the screaming device. Gerda draws her chef's knife to the ready. Penelope puts their welding mask down. Friend puts on some sunglasses. Penelope and Friend establish a rapport, donning and removing their respective face coverings, while Gerda and Red look on in bewilderment. Red asks what Friend is doing here. It beckons, chatters, and skitters toward the well, mentioning \"Imaginary friends.\" The party follows; Penelope eagerly, Red cautiously, and Gerda resignedly.<img alt=\"left hmed\" src=\"images/friend's-well.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Friend excitedly and frantically shows off its collection of \"wands,\" bones, fur (lots of purple fur), books, and maps.Gerda's eye is caught by a rowan wand, and for a moment, she moves to pick it up, before stopping herself. Noticing, Friend offers the wand to Gerda, which she cautiously accepts.Red asks if Friend is there alone, or if there are others. In response, Friend introduces the various dummies and dressing dolls as its friends. Bartholomew, Steve, Teapot, and Daisy are seated around a table set with what may once have been considered food.Gerda again hears the chattering of many overlapping voices. Realizing her concern, Friend refers to the noises she must be hearing as \"Stinkies,\" and sprinkles some purple pelts before them, repeating \"Stinkies.\" The smell gives the distinctive stench of the <a data-href=\"Abyss\" href=\"Abyss\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyss</a>. Friend points in the direction of the manor, indicating that many of the Stinkies were there. Elwing billows his cloak about him, before packing it away again.Penelope asked Friend whether they ought to be concerned about the Stinkies. Friend offers to show Penelope, and she agrees. Red follows, as does Gerda, despite her obvious skepticism as to the wisdom of this course of action.The party climbs up the well into the dark of the night. They enter the manor, which is in disarray.Friend interprets the chattering voices as they approach: Stinkies\nAll hail the rotten Lord of the three threes! All hail the keeper of the ever lost!! Return to us, oh Shadow that Was!! Return!!!!!\nGerda clearly has trepidations about continuing, but Penelope and Red want to at least investigate, to know whether these demonic creatures were trying to summon something worse, and whether they were a threat.<img alt=\"right hmed\" src=\"images/gibberling_5e.jpg\" target=\"_self\">When Gerda indicates that there are only just a few creatures, Penelope sees this as a reason to proceed, feeling that interrupting the summoning which she's sure must be taking place would make them heroes. They open the door, to see another hallway. Feeling a familiar coldness emanating from a room opposite the hallway, Red goes to investigate, finding <a data-href=\"cavern roses\" href=\"cavern roses\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">cavern roses</a>, which he's seen in his world before. He is concerned by their presence, but doesn't have long to examine them before he's alerted to the sound of Friend and Penelope entering the room down the hall with the Stinkies.Behind the door, which opens with no resistance, are three of the creatures. Penelope charges in, followed by Friend. Hearing the commotion, Gerda joined the fighting, throwing her filet knife as though it were a dart, hitting a Stinky. Red was close behind. Successfully charming one of the creatures, Red asks it, \"Why are you here?\" It responds in <a data-href=\"Abyssal\" href=\"Abyssal\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyssal</a>, which Friend interprets: Stinky\nTo make mischief and to eat (to eat, to eat). <br>\nYou're powerful. We could use that. Give me some of your hair.\nIn response, he takes a swipe at the demon, which dodges, cackling, before biting the elf.

Perhaps writing them down will help to clarify things.I've been dreaming of the two trees again. The moment I close my eyes I see them standing in that cursed plain and I feel that wretched tug to follow the road. I hoped this would be the time that I could ignore it and stay safe alone at home but if anything it has only grown in intensity. I had to leave and I am sorry. I asked the ivy to please not grow over your marker since I won't be able to prune it.On the way a strange urchin named <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Penelope Tillnot\" data-href=\"Penelope Tillnot\" href=\"player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Penelope</a> attached herself to my side. She is small and noisy with many strange devices attached to her. She talks as though speech will be banned in the next moment, but her chattering feels oddly comforting and since we were traveling the same direction it didn't seem necessary to avoid her company. Eventually we met a strange fae with a cloak of leaves and a reserved demeanor. The name they gave was <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Elwing\" data-href=\"Elwing\" href=\"player-characters/elwing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Red</a> and given the stories I've heard, perhaps I too should have been more careful...The sky grew dark and rain seemed likely. I decided to head for a ruined set of buildings to make some sort of shelter. To my great surprise and fear, they were already inhabited by a fearsome creature with hard plates like a bug and fierce pincers. Penelope and Red seemed to be able to communicate with it almost immediately and followed it down a well. I would have much preferred to stay up top but I find myself more and more concerned with the safety of these children.Inside the well, it became obvious the creature is lonely. <a data-href=\"Friend\" href=\"player-characters/friend.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Friend</a>, as it appears to call itself, (inside the well I began to hear a voice in my head that I believe to the creature, a minor horror I am choosing not to think about at the moment) has been living here and has killed some number of demonic furry creatures. Penelope grew excited at this and she, Red and Friend all left the well to hunt for more in the large house. Inside the house we began to explore and identified a space where more seemed to lurk. However Red chose to take a detour and though conflicted, I followed Red to a separate room but before anything happened, I heard a great crashing noise. Penelope and Friend must have rushed into danger! I returned to the hallway to see that they had entered the room with the demons. I only had time to throw my filet knife before the fight ended so perhaps my fear was unnecessary. Regardless, if I am going to remain with this trio of peculiar creatures I am going to have to get used to danger it seems.May we meet again, my heartNavigation\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Index\" data-href=\"Index\" href=\"index.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Return to Homepage</a>\n<a data-href=\"Archive 1\" href=\"session-logs/1/archive-1.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Archive 1</a>\n<a data-href=\"Penelope 1\" href=\"session-logs/1/penelope-1.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Penelope 1</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Gerda 1","level":1,"id":"Gerda 1"}],"links":["player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html","player-characters/elwing.html","player-characters/friend.html","index.html","session-logs/1/archive-1.html","session-logs/1/penelope-1.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"session-logs/1/gerda-1.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1725819375882,"modifiedTime":1726099263567,"sourceSize":2895,"sourcePath":"Session logs/1/Gerda 1.md","exportPath":"session-logs/1/gerda-1.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["index.html","player-characters/gerda.html","session-logs/1/archive-1.html","session-logs/1/penelope-1.html","session-logs/2/archive-2.html"],"type":"markdown"},"session-logs/1/penelope-1.html":{"title":"Penelope 1","icon":"","description":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Penelope Tillnot\" data-href=\"Penelope Tillnot\" href=\"player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Penelope</a>’s Super Heroic Adventure Log\nEntry 1<br>\nFlamecrest 1, 32 (3rd Age) (Apparently the people of this plane actually care about measuring time. That’s going to take some getting used to…)I found out that my adventuring supplies had this notebook in it, so I’m keeping a log of my adventure in the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Rakāuvi\" data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"locations/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Prime Material</a>. You need some record of your heroics to be a real hero, right? So I figured I'd make that record for myself! After a really enthusiastic sendoff, I left the village where I landed. Apparently the locals call this place <a data-href=\"Yewdon\" href=\"Yewdon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Yewdon</a>, and there’s occasional miasma events??? That seems dangerous, I should look into upgrading my mask with some sort of filters. <a data-href=\"Steel Jack\" href=\"Steel Jack\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Steel Jack</a> had something like that for when the reactor of <a data-href=\"Jackknife\" href=\"Jackknife\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Jackknife</a> starting spitting out fumes. It’s a shame I never got to see it for myself, that could have been helpful…Right, I’m off track, I started off to follow those dreams I had that brought me here. Along the way, I ran into an old Firbolg, who apparently had the same dreams as me! Well, I didn’t find that out until later, but maybe the order of things doesn’t have to be exact. The point is, her name is <a data-href=\"Gerda\" href=\"player-characters/gerda.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Gerda</a> and we started walking together, except she moves a lot faster than me with my short legs. We got to the plain from my dreams, the one with the trees, and we ran into some sort of Fae person there too. He showed up in a flurry of autumn leaves, though he wouldn’t tell us his name, so I’m just calling him <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Elwing\" data-href=\"Elwing\" href=\"player-characters/elwing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Red</a> until he wants to share (don’t worry, I asked and he’s fine with it).Gerda said that there was something called “rain” coming, which is apparently when the sky starts to just drop water on you. (There’s so many weird things about this plane.) Luckily there was a ruined village nearby, so we stopped there for shelter. (Side note: this would be an AMAZING place to live, there’s so much stuff to fix!) Living in one of the barns was an insect, but like a big one! And it could talk (kinda)! It called itself “<a data-href=\"Friend\" href=\"player-characters/friend.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Friend</a>” so that’s what I’m calling it. Friend seems to have been living here for a bit down a well, and it definitely seemed happy to have some real company. (Side note: we definitely need to clean up for it, its well is messier than my workshop back on <a data-href=\"Cados\" href=\"Cados\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Cados</a>.)Friend showed us around its well and told us about “Stinkies” (that name is definitely accurate) that were in the mansion next to the well, so I asked to see them. Friend took us up to the mansion and after some brief investigative work, we sprung into action and took them out. Oh, right! They were chanting about the Rotten Lord of the Three Threes, which sounds like some bad demon stuff… But we dealt with them, so we’re basically already heroes! Elwing and Gerda even came running over to help, so I think they care more than they’re letting on. Those demons are no match for the power of The Dream Team! (Get it? Because we all had a dream… well actually Friend doesn’t sleep… I guess we all had a vision of this place. Close enough.)Navigation\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Index\" data-href=\"Index\" href=\"index.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Return to Homepage</a>\n<a data-href=\"Archive 1\" href=\"session-logs/1/archive-1.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Archive 1</a>\n<a data-href=\"Gerda 1\" href=\"session-logs/1/gerda-1.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Gerda 1</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Penelope 1","level":1,"id":"Penelope 1"}],"links":["player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html","locations/rakāuvi.html","Yewdon","Steel Jack","Jackknife","player-characters/gerda.html","player-characters/elwing.html","player-characters/friend.html","Cados","index.html","session-logs/1/archive-1.html","session-logs/1/gerda-1.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"session-logs/1/penelope-1.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1725819108947,"modifiedTime":1726235141527,"sourceSize":3327,"sourcePath":"Session logs/1/Penelope 1.md","exportPath":"session-logs/1/penelope-1.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["index.html","player-characters/elwing.html","session-logs/1/archive-1.html","session-logs/1/gerda-1.html","session-logs/2/archive-2.html"],"type":"markdown"},"session-logs/2/archive-2.html":{"title":"Archive 2","icon":"","description":"Session 2\nSeptember 8th, 2024 (CE)\nFlamecrest 1, 32 (3rd Age)\nNow that the Stinkies no longer draw breath, the party gets a better look at their surroundings. The room they're in is full of broken musical instruments. <a data-href=\"Gerda\" href=\"player-characters/gerda.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Gerda</a> retrieves her thrown filet knife from one of the creatures, and lights up the room to get a better look around. Several beautiful music boxes at the far end of the room become illuminated.<br>\n<img alt=\"hsmall right\" src=\"images/music-boxes.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Penelope Tillnot\" data-href=\"Penelope Tillnot\" href=\"player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Penelope</a> immediately goes to the trinkets, testing them out. Two are functional, but one of the boxes has a little figurine elf which looks to have once been able to dance, but no longer. Penelope puts the inoperative music box in her bag to fix later. Gerda reprimands Penelope for taking someone else's property, but the gnome holds her ground, citing adventurers' rights- there are no longer any living souls around with a better claim to the loot than the party.<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Elwing\" data-href=\"Elwing\" href=\"player-characters/elwing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Red</a> examines one of the music boxes, noting its fairy with butterfly wings, indicative of the <a data-href=\"Summer\" href=\"Summer\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Summer</a> court. He activates the device, listening to its tune. As it ends, the tiny fairy springs up with a slight crackle of static electricity. Red considers how strange it is to find so many items from <a data-href=\"the Feywild\" href=\"the Feywild\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Feywild</a> in this <a data-href=\"Yewdon\" href=\"Yewdon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Yewdon</a> manor, adding the music box to his bag.Gerda examines the remaining music box, which has an elemental figure moving through a slow, controlled series of moves. Like her companions, Gerda stows the box in her bag. Aware of this seeming disparity to her earlier words to Penelope, Gerda comments that she wouldn't want to break up the set.Friend picks at the harp, before riffling through some musical scrolls at the piano. They discard the scrolls with any musical notation, keeping the ones that were blank.Now that combat has ended, Red wants to return to the room with the <a data-href=\"cavern roses\" href=\"cavern roses\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">cavern roses</a>. The others need no convincing to follow. Gerda and Red examine them together. The faint fragrance is reminiscent of honeysuckle; the purple and blue flowers- which have already bloomed once- are ready to bloom again.\nThese cavern roses are on the outer bounds of the flower patch, and have been growing unchecked for at least a year or two. Gerda suggests going through the nearby door, behind which there are likely more flowers. As she pushes it open, the air becomes noticeably colder.<br>\n<img alt=\"hmed left\" src=\"images/cold-iron-cavern-rose.png\" target=\"_self\">In the next room is a banquet table that looks to be set up for a feast. Fine dishes and plush chairs surround the table, covered by many, many more cavern roses, and some big ones. The floor above the largest flower has collapsed downward, and Friend can see a faint blue pulsing light fading in and out through the hole to the room above.Friend\nStars...\nRed picks up a sample of one of the smaller flowers, breaking about half of the roots, but probably not enough to kill it. Gerda cuts a bit of the plant off, briefly staining her knife, before wiping it away.The tips of the spiked vines sway slightly, despite there being no breeze. Friend wants to get to the \"stars\" by way of the plants, but Penelope suggests taking the stairs to get to the room above.Upstairs, the party enters a greenhouse-like scene. The carpet is soaked and stained with rotting leaves. A stone enclosure surrounds a garden of three enormous trees and bunches of flowers. The leftmost tree is an oak, with bark that seems to glow with gold and amber. The center tree is blue, with metallic, glowing globes growing from its branches. On the right is a maple tree, which Red recognizes from his own <a data-href=\"Autumn\" href=\"Autumn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Autumn</a> court.<br>\n<img alt=\"trees in manor.JPG\" src=\"images/trees-in-manor.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br>\nThese three fey trees are young, perhaps 5 or 6 years old. Although they once had been planted and tended to, they seem to have been abandoned, not having been pruned or cared for recently. Knowing little about these trees, Gerda goes to examine a desk, which holds an hourglass and some alchemical equipment. Most of the bottles are partially destroyed, their contents long since evaporated, but Gerda she finds two unbroken bottles- one contains a potion of comprehend languages, and the other is a potion of climbing.Penelope moves on, opening the door that most directly leads to Friend's \"star.\" The room is dusty, with desks full of ink bottles, ink stones, and packages wrapped in oil cloth. An open scroll can be seen, with writing in an elvish script. Some letters are folded into little paper tressym- cats with wings.<img alt=\"hm-sm right\" src=\"images/kazaran-symbol.jpg\" target=\"_self\">On the other side of the room is an altar that was once been arranged with flowers, ferns, and what might be memorial tablets. A symbol is visible, a spiral that blooms into leaves, denoting <a data-href=\"Kaza'ran\" href=\"Kaza'ran\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Kaza'ran</a>. Gerda lights the candles, murmuring an apology to the deity of life for the altar's lack of care.Red looks through the shelves and papers. The family seems to have been named Greysky. The documents are invitations, some half-written, others already folded into tressym. The letters are addressed to other Greysky families, inviting them to visit and see their success. Red surveys the room, so clearly set to entertain, and wonders aloud what happened and whether the visitors ever came.Friend adds some of the ink stones to its collection. The bundled packets contain pale blue-grey leaves, which gave off a fine fragrance. Seeing no other immediate uses for the leaves, Friend proceeds to munch on the contents of one package. Gerda comments that it would be nice to have tea some evening. Friend obligingly hands the remaining packets over to the firbolg, who seems to know what to do with them, and has somewhat more refined intentions.Penelope starts examining the north wall, reasoning that the area behind some ivy might be soft enough to punch through, and far more direct than taking the hallway which connected the rooms. She catapults the fern pot against the wall, successfully making a hole large enough to crawl through.<img alt=\"hmed left\" src=\"images/silver-mithral-lead-box.png\" target=\"_self\">In the room beyond, a glowing, silvery box sits atop some splintered planks and boards, next to a hole in the floor. The box is a small, square chest, tipped over on its side. The outside shines with hints of mithral, while the inside is lined with lead (which Penelope explains has the ability to block detection magic). Its lid, which has a star on it, is swung open in the direction of the hole. Any contents the box may have once contained have long since fallen down to the floor below. Penelope wonders whether the cavern rose seeds were what it was meant to hold.\nFriend looks through a stack of books. It leafs through one title in particular, Shameful Swordplay: How to Fake Being a Martial Archetype with any Style of Magic by Telvrin Melkar. The volume details the use of illusion and trickery to boost combat abilities, mimicking physical weapons with magic, and most importantly: how to win and NOT get caught when using the techniques described within. The book has been banned in the Irieaboreal Empire, to the east of Yewdon.The next room, mostly overgrown with plants, is a huge bedroom, where the party decides to take a long rest.Friend takes first watch.Gerda and Penelope each dream of the barren plain and the twin trees. Red trances. He sees a necklace with a little sprig of red pine needles, something Delight always has with her. For the first time, instead of seeing a vision of the plain, he sees Delight's hand, fiddling with the necklace. She is in a spiral staircase going down, down, down. At first the footsteps are quick and energetic, but as the dream continues, Delight seems to be getting fatigued, as each step becomes more difficult.\nJust before waking, Red sees a door. He cannot see what's inside, but a pale yellow-green light is shining under the door. For an instant, Red forgets Delight, feeling only the desire to get to the door and pass through it. He awakens as Friend rouses him for his turn to take watch. It then takes up a spot on the floor, where it spends the remainder of the night, motionless. Recite\nFlamecrest 2, 32 (3rd Age)\nDay comes again. Light pours in through the damaged ceiling. Penelope, bright eyed from not having taken a watch, approaches the still motionless Friend, taking a few measurements and assessing the creature's general head shape. She makes some adjustments to the top hat she'd snagged from the closet the day before, modifying it to fit her towering Friend.\nUpon completion, Friend chitters excitedly, striking poses and attempting to look regal in the hat they have long coveted.\nThe gnome isn't finished giving gifts, though. She approaches Gerda, offering her a set of dark vision goggles. They are similar to the ones she herself wears, but they have clearly been designed to fit the firbolg's more homey, utilitarian style, rather than Penelope's flair for the flamboyant. <br>\nThroughout all this, the artificer is noticeably less encumbered by the many backpacks and bags she'd previously been carrying. In explanation, she shows off her new fanny pack of holding, and offers to carry things for her companions as well.The party discusses their next course of action. Penelope wants to continue looking around before departing toward the twin trees. It wouldn't be very heroic to leave these problematic roses to grow and spread.Using his smithing tools, Red examines the mithral box they'd found the previous day. Constellations decorate the exterior, with each star made up of a <a data-href=\"draconic\" href=\"draconic\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">draconic</a> character. The exquisite craftsmanship combined with the draconic script indicate that this box was constructed by a metallic dragon, or someone who studied under one.At Penelope's request, Friend tosses the gnome across the hole in the floor of the room. Penelope lands on the far side and opens a door to find a vine-filled hallway. She follows it around, sneaking to the far side of the party, purposefully startling her companions. Gerda, having only just been spooked by Penelope, feels a light tickle on her neck. She is startled to find a tawny owl feather to be the source, but looking up to the various holes in the ceiling, can see nothing to indicate its origin. Disconcerted, she pockets the feather.The firbolg suggests dangling Penelope down through the hole in the floor, to the maw of the enormous flower below, where whatever was in the silver box must have fallen. Although this proposal was made somewhat wryly, the gnome's approval is sincere.Penelope\n\"I'm ready to be a hero!\"\nThey fashion a climbing harness and fling the free line over a beam that still seems secure. A second line of rope is looped and knotted around Gerda, who will act as an anchor, keeping Penelope from falling too far. Friend is the one lowering the rope. \"Don't think of squids,\" Penelope repeats to herself as she slowly descends. <img alt=\"hmed right\" src=\"images/grabby-stick.png\" target=\"_self\">Struck with inspiration, Penelope requests that she be pulled up again briefly. She tinkers and fiddles for a few minutes, fashioning a Grabby Claw to extend her reach by 5 feet.She gets lowered once more to the floral maw, new device in hand. As she pokes around, the flower begins to close around the claw, and Penelope narrowly withdraws her tool before the petals surround it completely.She notices that the cool mist they've been seeing in the manor seems to be emitted from the maw.<br>\nRed observes that the little tips of the vines start moving a bit more, as though it is beginning to wake. Gerda\n\"I'm willing to risk Penelope one more time.\"\nFor the third time, Penelope is pulleyed down until she can reach around in the plant once more. The claw clinks against something hard and she withdraws her tool with the object in its clasp.Friend pulls Penelope up, and as she rises, so does the cold and mist. Penelope produces the lead-lined box from her pack and drops the prize inside, where it can finally be seen by the party. The item is a metallic, blue-grey pearl the size of a walnut. Friend feels something akin to nausea from the item's proximity, and Red is likewise unsettled. He names the pearl as cold iron, a material that is deadly to fey.Navigation\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Index\" data-href=\"Index\" href=\"index.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Return to Homepage</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Archive 2","level":1,"id":"Archive 2"}],"links":["player-characters/gerda.html","player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html","player-characters/elwing.html","Summer","the Feywild","Yewdon","cavern roses","Autumn","Kaza'ran","draconic","index.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"session-logs/2/archive-2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["images/music-boxes.html","images/cold-iron-cavern-rose.html","images/trees-in-manor.html","images/kazaran-symbol.html","images/silver-mithral-lead-box.html","images/grabby-stick.html"],"createdTime":1725839587820,"modifiedTime":1726099284739,"sourceSize":20615,"sourcePath":"Session logs/2/Archive 2.md","exportPath":"session-logs/2/archive-2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"session-logs/2/elwing-2.html":{"title":"Elwing 2","icon":"","description":"Elwing’s meditation diary\nEntry 1There is so much I must meditate about. Just a few days ago, I was living a different life. I feel like I was a different elf. Surely more open and trusting. I suppose there has been so much going on that it’s going to take me some time to be that elf again. My fellow travelers seem really nice creatures. They call me Red, but I guess I should let them know my real name soon. I feel like I should stop being scared and start trusting them all.This house is full of unexpected surprises. Just like the open boxes with music. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Penelope Tillnot\" data-href=\"Penelope Tillnot\" href=\"player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Penelope</a> is carrying the fairy one in their backpack (I wouldn’t be surprised to find out they are fitting a giant in there – the backpack probably doesn’t have a bottom. I should totally get one.)<br>\nThe sound coming from the music box reminds me of the beautiful sounds of the <a data-href=\"Summer\" href=\"Summer\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Summer</a> Forest. I can see the sand dunes, the mountains, the river and all the fairy looking like dragonfly &amp; butterfly. So different than what I am used to in my forest. What is this box doing in this house? And why were these creatures inspired by summer?But that’s not my only perplexity – and surely not the biggest one. This house is full of <a data-href=\"Cavern Roses\" href=\"Cavern Roses\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Cavern Roses</a>, the same roses that came out of the rift that opened in my homeland. Their fragrance reminds me of Honeysuckles and there are small blue dots on the purple texture. <a data-href=\"Gerda\" href=\"player-characters/gerda.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Gerda</a> was by my side during the inspection, trying to help me figure out why these flowers were all over the place. It seemed like there were more in the other room. So, we opened the door just to find out the huge dining room in front of us was covered with Cavern Roses. A cold fog was lingering all around us. The place looked like it was set up for a feast that never saw its glory. I have a bad feeling – something happened here.\nThere was a huge hole in the ceiling, right on top of the biggest of these roses. I got one of the small plants, and one of the roots broke. I am trying to use water to keep it alive - for later scientific research endeavors.After a while, we went upstairs and found a new room with an oak tree, a maple tree and a blue tree (they are all growing naturally, apparently). I could recognize the maple. It looked just like those in my court, the Northern section of my court, to be more accurate, where people are experts in healing. Again… what is a maple tree doing here?\nWe later moved to a different room, and found a couple of interesting potions, unwrapped packages and some papers with the name “GREYSKY”. It must be the name of the family (?) living here. The letters were written in Elvish, it seems like an invitation to someone for dinner. I wonder where they are and what happened to them – the table is covered with fine porcelain but also dust, just like something bigger came up and prevented the dinner from ever taking place…Before going to sleep, we were attracted by a blue light coming from the room next door. The blue light was coming from a blue box that clearly fell, causing a hole in the floor. There is a constellation on top of the box, a constellation that I don’t know. The points are made by a series of characters in draconic that give some explanation about the constellation. It looks like it has been manufactured by a dragon.<br>\nAfter a long day, we took a break for a night’s rest. I tranced, as I always do, ready to see the field with the 2 trees. But they were gone. I saw <a data-href=\"Sodalite\" href=\"Sodalite\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sodalite</a> this time. She was under a staircase, going down in a spiral. She was getting tired, her steps getting heavier. The last thing I saw was a door. There was something behind the door. Pale. Green. I felt the urge to walk through that door.

There’s so much stuff in here, and most of it seems like it’s from another plane (or at least that’s what Red was saying). After we defeated those stinkies, we took a look around the room they were in and found a few music boxes. One of them was broken, so I grabbed it to have a tinkering project (I’m pretty sure if I do it right, I can make the joints of the dancer articulated so it can do cooler dances), but <a data-href=\"Gerda\" href=\"player-characters/gerda.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Gerda</a> told me it might be stealing. Thankfully <a data-href=\"Steel Jack\" href=\"Steel Jack\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Steel Jack</a> taught me the Adventurers’ Rights back when I thought taking loot was bad, so I knew it was fine. Besides, she took some other stuff later, so I think she saw it my way. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Elwing\" data-href=\"Elwing\" href=\"player-characters/elwing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Red</a> told us about those flowers, the cavern… uh… flowers… which are apparently kinda bad. They look nice and smell nice too, though, but he seemed pretty serious about how they would force out native flora. Oh! Roses! <a data-href=\"Cavern Roses\" href=\"Cavern Roses\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Cavern Roses</a>, that’s it! He and Gerda led us over to where they had seen them, and we took a look around into some fancy dining room. All the chairs were like the chair <a data-href=\"Captain Arador\" href=\"Captain Arador\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Captain Arador</a> had, which meant they looked really comfortable, if you disregard the MASSIVE CAVERN ROSE PLANT that was taking up most of them. It seemed like it kinda grew out of control, it had big thorny vines and something like a mouth, which definitely seemed like it would eat meat when I was over it, but I’m getting ahead of myself.<a data-href=\"Friend\" href=\"player-characters/friend.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Friend</a> saw something glowing from a hole above the plant, so we explored upstairs and there’s an ENTIRE ABORETUM HERE! It had trees from <a data-href=\"the Feywild\" href=\"the Feywild\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Feywild</a> (at least that’s what Red said)! Trees! Inside! From other planes! Apparently the family that used to live here were called Greysky, and were probably elves? (At least, Red said the letters were written in Elvish, so that would make sense. Then again, maybe they just knew Elvish? It’s probably not important.) The room we found the letters in didn’t have the “star” that Friend saw, so I knocked a hole in the wall, because Steel Jack always said, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. It turns out the star was actually a box made of silver and mithril lined with lead. Red said the box was MADE BY A DRAGON (or at least someone who had studied under a dragon) which is SO COOL! I’m hanging on to the box in hopes I might get to meet the dragon someday. Maybe they’ll teach me how to make such high-quality goods.After that, everyone was tired so we slept through the night, but I had some time to make a hat for Friend and some goggles for Gerda (she seemed kinda clumsy in the dark, so hopefully those help). Everyone was trying to decide whether to leave or keep exploring, but I convinced them we should deal with the plant first, because if Red says they’re bad for the local ecosystem, it wouldn’t be heroic to leave it be. I made a new invention that I’m calling a Grabby Claw that let me reach inside it safely (Gerda said one of us could hang down over it, which was a great idea!) and I pulled out a material Red called “Cold Iron” which is apparently really bad for the Fey. It seems like it might have fallen out of the box, so I put it back in there for safekeeping. Things like that should really stay in safe hands, and mine are the safest I know!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Penelope 2","level":1,"id":"Penelope 2"}],"links":["player-characters/gerda.html","Steel Jack","player-characters/elwing.html","Cavern Roses","Captain Arador","player-characters/friend.html","the Feywild"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"session-logs/2/penelope-2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1726751754089,"modifiedTime":1726752006353,"sourceSize":3446,"sourcePath":"Session logs/2/Penelope 2.md","exportPath":"session-logs/2/penelope-2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"session-logs/3/archive-3.html":{"title":"Archive 3","icon":"","description":"Session 3\nSeptember 15th, 2024 (CE)\nFlamecrest 2, 32 (3rd Age)\nAfter retrieving the lump of cold iron from the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"cavern roses\" data-href=\"cavern roses\" href=\"cavern roses\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">cavern rose</a>, the party takes a break, munching some rations as they discuss their next moves. Shut in the lead-lined box, it was no longer a danger to anyone. But, as <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Penelope Tillnot\" data-href=\"Penelope Tillnot\" href=\"player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Penelope</a> points out, while they may have removed the cold iron that was empowering the cavern roses, the plants themselves remain a threat to the local ecosystem. <a data-href=\"Gerda\" href=\"player-characters/gerda.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Gerda</a>, not necessarily in disagreement, asks Penelope about her reasons for taking on the responsibility. The gnome reiterates that the party's status as \"heroes\" demands that they take action. Gerda responds that she'll keep a lookout for some herbicide. At that, they begin to tour the remaining rooms in the manor. They start in what turns out to be quite a fancy bathroom, with lotions and glass pitchers on its adorned counters.<img alt=\"hmed left\" src=\"images/manor-bedrooms.png\" target=\"_self\"> Next they look through some bedrooms. The toys, dollhouse, and size of the furniture suggest that the occupants had been children. There is a small, partially-packed suitcase on the floor. The bottom layer is mostly toys, with some clothes sensibly piled on top, as though some adult had come along to pack essentials after the child had only packed playthings. However, the fact that the suitcase remains indicates that although it was packed, there wasn't time in the end for its owner to grab it.By way of a common area with some furniture in the hall, the party returns to the arboretum. Checking the alchemical table again for possible herbicide ingredients, Penelope finds a pouch of what looks like ash, labeled 'Caustic.' They determine the powder to be ashes from an ironscale hydra, a creature with acidic blood. This substance is used to eradicate parasitic infections, typically used underground.The party debates whether to keep the powder in dry form, or perhaps mixed with water. Penelope suggests a catapult, though Gerda recommends pouring the mix through the hole in the ceiling above the plants.Gerda and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Elwing\" data-href=\"Elwing\" href=\"player-characters/elwing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Red</a> combine their \"plantology\" knowledge, hatching a plan to attack the plants at the center of the largest mass.They go upstairs.The room across from the music room is a library. The books are waterlogged, but largely in good condition. Drop clothes cover the majority of the furniture in the room.A topographical map of a subterranean area can be seen on the center table. The map appears to be of a drow community (a subterranean race of elves with extraordinary dark vision, but considerable light sensitivity), called Ungethal.<a data-href=\"Friend\" href=\"player-characters/friend.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Friend</a> has seen more detailed maps of these areas, showing collapsed and damaged passages around some of the enormous caverns that collapsed in the <a data-href=\"Spellplague\" href=\"Spellplague\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Spellplague</a>. Friend works on making a replication of this three-dimensional map on some parchment. Gerda takes careful note of the map as well, making a remarkably good copy. Friend watches with curiosity and approval.One table has its drop cloth pulled aside. Based on the relative amounts of dust collected, Gerda estimates that someone has come through the room in the past year. On the table sits another ornate box that matches the craftsmanship of the mithral box the party found the previous day. This one has many bands of metal (gold, silver, bronze, copper, and brass) weaving around its faces. The box is closed and latched, but unlocked.To one side of the box is another music box. To the other side is an empty place where there something else looks to have been placed.Penelope excitedly informs the party that the different bands of metal correspond with the metallic dragon types, another connection to dragons which the gnome sees as more than coincidence. Red examines this new box, seeing no writing, just the intricate inlay and weaving of the metals. Gerda flips the latch and opens the metal box, which is empty. The music box, when shut, has the appearance of an egg. When opened, a little copper wyrmling constructed of intricate copper gears begins to rise, rearing its little head into a roar. As the only party member without a music box, Friend becomes the new owner of this one. Moving on to the shelves, the party members look through the collection of books:Red: Example\nParadoxomicon: Collected works of a plane-shifter wizard who has dedicated his life to finding loopholes in magic and testing them in parallel planes of existence, collapsing each one of them in doing so.\nGerda: Example\nThe Convergent Truth': The Convergent Truth is a detailed explanation about why the plane you are in right now is a demi-plane, an exact copy of the material plane, used to lure something called The Devourer, the Unmaker, away from the true material plane.\nPenelope: Example\nLoves Return: This book is pale green with black lettering and an embossed cartoonish skull in the center of the cover. Inside this book is a tale in the style of a children's story about losing a loved one and how to bring them back from beyond the grave. Disturbingly the book gives a fully functional process of ritually summoning an undead with such ease.\nFriend:Example\nThe Writings Of Theon Ganderson': A small black journal kept by a man who claimed to have spotted a 'thing' living under his farm house. This 'thing' turned out to be a small abomination being that began eating Theon's livestock. The journal ends abruptly during a passage where Theon is describing hearing something underneath his floorboards.\nThe remaining unexplored area of the house is an enormous ballroom. Remnants of a smashed chandelier coat the floor. Its candles have long scratches that match the shape of the Stinkies' teeth. At the center of the floor is a fountain that has long since dried up. Archways and trellises adorn the outer edges of the room with large metal urns on display.The party sifts through the rubble. Gerda finds a few candles in good condition. Friend collects a few glass bottles that are sealed with wax. There are finely painted labels on the outside: one depicts a three-headed dog, with its heads breathing fire, breathing frost, and with blood dripping from its muzzle, respectively. Another bottle has a nice countryside painting. Uninterested in alcohol as a consumable, Friend keeps the bottles anyway, perhaps to try as a cleaning solution.Red examines the urns. They contain ashes, likely the ancestors of the Greysky family, with names inlaid in a beautiful script. The elvish surname Ianna, which translates to \"sky of stone\" or \"grey sky\" in <a data-href=\"Common\" href=\"Common\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Common</a>, accompanies the following names listed:Recite\nSundamar\nCorym\nSyvis The party returns to the room above the cavern roses. Penelope puts on all of her protective gear and portions out half of the caustic powder, allowing herself room for a second attempt. Gerda offers to help as well. Penelope agrees, giving her some gloves and instructing her to don her goggles. She ejects the rest of the party from the room. Penelope\n\"Hazmat rules.\"\nUsing her grabby claw to extend her reach over the hole in the floor above the plants, Penelope drops the little packet of powder.<br>\nAnticlimactically, there is no immediate change as the dust cloud spreads in the flower room. The party decides that the job's probably done, but they'll come back in a week to make sure the plants are all dead.It's now just coming on to noon. Gerda remarks that if they leave now, they should be able to get to the trees on the barren plain by nightfall. Penelope invites Friend to accompany them to the trees, who eagerly agrees, making a stop by their well to grab the essentials, including Daisy. The party leaves the manor behind. The further away they get, the harder the ground gets. The grass fades, and what little there is left is yellow and dried. The plant life variety diminishes to some broadleaf plants and grass strands.Penelope, who is unaccustomed to such corporeal-based transportation, spends about an hour trotting to keep up, before requesting a piggyback ride from Friend, who wordlessly agrees.As they travel, Red's cloak fades from its vibrant red and orange to the dull green, pale yellow that surrounds them. Friend's carapace likewise camouflages to match the environmental hues. Penelope is talking non-stop to Friend, explaining the minutiae of the artificer class. Friend listens politely, retaining nothing.Finally, they arrive at the trees. Gerda is the only one who has been here before, back when it used to be a forest. But the wood has gone brittle and dry. The plants have patches where the veins of the leaves grow black. Sap has dried in corrupted, grey-colored clumps. A strange combination of noises can be heard coming from nearby: the growling of a lion, the snapping of a crocodile jaw, followed by, \"Fuck off, asshole.\" A clang of metal rings out, and the sound of pain.From far off, only two trees can be seen but as the party approaches, in the space between the two huge trees they see what appears to be the sheared off trunk of a third tree. Gerda points to some odd shapes atop the stump. A creature battling what seem to be several giant, floating eyes with tentacles. In the center is a tall, wingless crow person swinging a glaive and making a noise that sounds like a dragon's roar.??\n\"<a data-href=\"Bahamat\" href=\"Bahamat\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Bahamat</a>'s ballsack!\" The kenku continues making various intimidating animal noises and glaives one of the creatures. The eye beast deflates and expels a cloud of gas, which floats toward the kenku. \"That was stupid,\" he coughs, before losing consciousness.Penelope, still on Friend's back, urges her ride forward toward the fallen stranger. The gnome pulls her bandana up and her mask down. Friend complies with no hesitation, leaving Red and Gerda behind. The firbolg carefully watches for the cloud to dissipate, tying a handkerchief around her mouth, before approaching the scene with Red.\nFrom this distance, the Eladrin believes the floating eye creatures to be beholders, and calls out a warning to his companions about their terrifying abilities. The area is hazy and cloudy with what seems to be a pollen or dust. Red, despite his distance, makes the first attack with his longbow. His arrow hits the nearest creature, which bursts into another cloud of gas, though Red is far enough away to be unaffected.Penelope, still atop Friend's shoulders, fires at another with her crossbow, which likewise poofs.Friend moves in a stabs the remaining creature, killing it. The gas seeps out, and Friend is not able to escape it in time. They feel sluggish, as though poisoned, and sit to recover, now that combat has ended. Penelope, fortunately, was not affected by the gas. The party approaches the motionless kenku. As Penelope stabilizes him, she notices many layers of the pollen dust on his cloak, indicating that he has probably been in the area considerably longer. Now conscious, he opens his eyes and looks around. \"It's this much my favorite,\" he says in a child's voice, indicating a small space between his talons.\nPenelope asks if he is hurt. \"Unclear,\" comes the response. <br>Infobox <img alt=\"Click.png\" src=\"images/creatures/click.png\" target=\"_self\"> - Alive, Demon phage infected\nThe kenku make some clicking noises, followed by, \"Hi, I'm <a data-href=\"Click\" href=\"entities/npcs/click.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Click</a>!\"Penelope introduces herself, Gerda, and then Friend. The insectoid makes a weak gesture of greeting. Next she presents the elf as Red, who corrects her. Elwing\n\"My name is Elwing.\"\nGerda asks Click if he knows what happened to the trees. \"I could share, if you want,\" comes the response, to which the party all agrees. Click pulls out a slate and chalk and begins writing for a while. Meanwhile, Penelope asks after Friend, who sinks lower. She cures its wounds with her hammer. Friend's carapace undulates as it heals, but ass the colors shift, the tips of Friend's hands no longer change, they just remain black.Gerda and Elwing begin to notice draconic letters that are carved into the wood of the tree trunk they are all atop: Recite\n\"In the silver light of Krexis Tlaxxar, amongst his wyrm-touched wonders you tread. Through curiosity's veins, rooted deep, let your journey sprout. Fear not, mortal seedling, for you are sheltered in the timbered heart of discovery.\"\n<img alt=\"tree stump.jpg\" src=\"images/tree-stump.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Penelope points out the connection to <a data-href=\"Bahamat\" href=\"Bahamat\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Bahamat</a>, whom Click had invoked earlier, with the draconic letters. Bahamat is the father of righteousness, a great dragon. Many believe that it was out of Bahamat's imagination that the first dragons were created. Click\n\"I am Click. From <a data-href=\"The Shadowfel\" href=\"The Shadowfel\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">The Shadowfel</a>.\"\nClick's slate details how he had nightmares about the eggs of his family being smashed. When he begged the Raven Queen for answers, he was told to seek the two trees that remain, that have outlasted the corruption that poisoned the forest. He set off and found a path toward <a data-href=\"Yewdon\" href=\"Yewdon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Yewdon</a>, and is searching for the next clue. He mentions having gotten his \"feathers plucked,\" and that he is weakened by the effects of poison.Penelope asks Gerda whether she knows anything about the pollen. Gerda and Elwing examine it, and become convinced that it isn't actually plant material, but more like dense mushroom spores.\nLooking at how withered and dried the plants are all around, from the way the pollen reacts, it's almost as though it's aware. It reminds Gerda of the way demons begin to affect their environments to better suit them. This demon phage, a virus, is an infection that will continue to grow and change. if it progresses too far, it will first kill Friend, and then raise them as a demon.Elwing casts a spell to detect poison and disease. Basically everything around him is glowing. The plants, the creatures scurrying in the dirt; everything but the tree. The hue of disease is likewise emanating from Friend and Click.The party looks around for some refuge from the poison. Gerda wants to leave, but Elwing suggests that there there might be safety within the tree itself. Everyone looks around for some kind of entrance.\nA set of runes found in the roots of the tree surround a staircase and door leading into the tree. The path seems to be free from the phage.Gerda takes her potion of comprehension to read the celestial writing around the door: Recite\nIt is with great pleasure that I welcome you to my sanctum, a veritable trove of the strange and marvelous. Gaze upon the iridescent blooms of the Celestial Lotus, whose petals shimmer with the light of a thousand stars. Marvel at the Void-Forged Chalice, a vessel that seems to drink in the very shadows that surround it. And if you dare, step closer to the Obsidian Shard, a fragment of a fallen comet that whispers secrets of the cosmos.\nThe party gets the impression of a museum attraction as they enter the trunk steps leading down, inviting Click to join them. \"It's THIS much my favorite,\" he exclaims happily.They enter the tree, quickly closing the door behind them. The air inside is fresher, and the floor of the hollow tree is intricately carved. They descend the staircase and enter a room with a pedestal in the center. A large piece of blank parchment and a silver feather float above the pedestal. Across the room is an archway in the wall.\nA voice begins to speak in many languages. Callout\n\"What do you seek? Who are you?\"\nPenelope says, \"Hiya, I'm Penelope!\" The quill writes out her name. \"I'm Gerda, and I would love a resolution to this blasted dream,\" says the firbolg. Elwing gives his name and reiterates Gerda's desire for answers. \"Click. Hero.\"Penelope, realizing suddenly that she'd neglected to state her goal, interjects that she wants to stop the demons.Friend initially introduces itself telepathically, but there was no indication from the quill and parchment that the message was received. For the first time, in makes a series of audible chittering noises, which seem to be successfully communicated, as a series of alien markings are written on the parchment. \"Fix bad feeling,\" Friend concluded, indicating its discolored fingertips.After each member speaks their name and purpose, the archway turns into a doorway, with filigree filling the previously unadorned space.\nGerda asks Penelope what she knows about silver dragons, making a connection to the silver feather quill.<br>\n\"They like helping people, and hearing about how much they help people,\" Penelope replied.Gold pattern of the floor looks like it's been scratched in the floor by a giant claw, then filled in with a gold dust sealed into the floor, giving the room a constant divination effect. This divination array might help detect magical effects and items within the room.In the next room, a larger space, is a large table covered with bits of paper, parchment, scrolls, a bottle with a cork in it with a letter curled up within, maps, drawings, portraits, notes. Each piece is writtenby a different hand, in many different languages. Each seems to be a firsthand account of someone who has passed through the room.<img alt=\"table of knowledge.png\" src=\"images/table-of-knowledge.png\" target=\"_self\">Friend picks up a map from the table, and images from the different notations illuminate in the air as though the group can see the memories as glimpses from the perspective of the writer.Gerda looks about for writing implements. She writes a brief synopsis of what took place at the manor house, holding up the page in the same way that Friend had, and sees visual depictions of the description she'd just written.Experimentally, Penelope holds up her journal to the first page she'd already written, but nothing happens. Gerda picks up the paper she'd written on, folding it up and putting it in her pocket, distressed at the idea of leaving her memories behind.Friend takes the map it picked up to examine, rolls it up and slides it in with its other maps, before examining the room itself. They note illusion and evocation magic around the table.Penelope scans a paper that describes the first seven trees of <a data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"locations/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakāuvi</a>. She learns that acorns from the first Oak possess \"true resurrection magic.\" Then, Penelope sketches out a copy of the schematic for her grabby claw, leaving it on the table.Friend draws crude drawings of its companions, including Click, offering it to the table.[Click draws with chalk for a while] image depicting his not yet hatched chick he wants to meet and some simple melodies that his community uses to send messagesElwing writes up a paper on the properties of the cavern roses and offers it to the table.<br>\nImages of his home, the <a data-href=\"Autumn\" href=\"Autumn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Autumn</a> forest, fill the air with huge trees and a jagged rift where the cavern roses grow.When the last offering is given, a door appears, leading down a hallway.The next room reaches up higher than any room so far, with the ceiling out of sight. There are 4 alcoves about the room, three of them with shining, gleaming statues. In the center of the room is a fountain with 4 colors of dragon heads spitting water. A silver dragon sits above them all, facing the empty alcove, not spitting water. In the fountain, charms and coins are in the water.The statues in the alcoves are each about 10 feet tall.\nThe first is an older dwarvish man with a thick beard. He holds a closed book and a crystal ball, within which there is a stylized eye.\nThe next is a tall elvish woman. An ivy crown grows out of her hair, which is tied back. Around her neck is a necklace with a unicorn pendant. She carries a bow, which is drawn.<br>\nThe third statue is a tiefling, holding an axe in each hand, crossed over their chest. Only stumps remain where magnificent horns once grew, apparently having been chopped off. One eye looks to be made of ruby- the other has been pried out. Gerda notices that each of the three statues has an element that points to the empty alcove; the gaze of the eye, the direction of the drawn bow, the face of the tiefling. She walks into the alcove. Fuchsia light begins to glow; a few moments pass. Then Gerda disappears.Alarmed, Elwing begins to tell his remaining companions that he wants to keep the party together, but he could scarcely open his mouth to speak before Penelope, followed by Click, enter the alcove as well. They strike a pose and vanish. Friend doesn't want to be left behind. Elwing takes up the rear.Navigation\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Index\" data-href=\"Index\" href=\"index.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Return to Homepage</a>\n<a data-href=\"Penelope 3\" href=\"session-logs/3/penelope-3.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Penelope 3</a> ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Archive 3","level":1,"id":"Archive 3"},{"heading":"=this.file.name","level":7,"id":"`=this.file.name`"}],"links":["cavern roses","player-characters/penelope-tillnot.html","player-characters/gerda.html","player-characters/elwing.html","player-characters/friend.html","Spellplague","Common","Bahamat","Yewdon","entities/npcs/click.html","Bahamat","The Shadowfel","Yewdon","locations/rakāuvi.html","Autumn","index.html","session-logs/3/penelope-3.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"session-logs/3/archive-3.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["images/manor-bedrooms.html","entities/npcs/click.html","images/creatures/click.html","images/tree-stump.html","images/table-of-knowledge.html"],"createdTime":1726439530706,"modifiedTime":1728221619289,"sourceSize":27527,"sourcePath":"Session logs/3/Archive 3.md","exportPath":"session-logs/3/archive-3.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["entities/npcs/click.html","index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"session-logs/3/penelope-3.html":{"title":"Penelope 3","icon":"","description":"Penelope’s Super Heroic Adventure Log Entry 3\nFlamecrest 2I finally feel like a real adventurer!

They also were into some really weird stuff, like they had a giant bag of Ironscale Hydra ashes!! Why would anyone with a house this nice need those??? Plus, the bag was just left in a desk!

Even Gerda seems to be more social than she was yesterday, everyone is really getting along.There’s so much weird stuff in this house, like a map of a Drow settlement called Ungethal. There was also another DragonBox™, this time made out of copper, brass, bronze, silver, and gold, plus there was a music box that was a dragon egg that opened up into a wyrmling! I don’t know what was going on with this family, but there definitely seems like there’s some strong dragon ties (which also makes sense with the tree stump we found later, but I’m getting ahead of myself again).<br>\nAfter we explored, I reminded everyone we needed to deal with the Cavern Roses, so we dumped enough ash onto the main plant to deal with the entire system, though at my insistence we didn’t stick around to watch it happen. I don’t want aerosolized Ironscale Hydra ash getting into my lungs, that’s a major workplace hazard. After that, we headed out towards the trees from everyone’s dreams. When we got there, we found a Kenku named <a data-href=\"Click\" href=\"entities/npcs/click.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Click</a> who was fighting some weird floating bags that were apparently filled with demon spores! Well, ok, maybe not actually, but Gerda said is was basically demon pollen that would corrupt an area, which seems super bad. Luckily, we fought them off and helped Click, though he and <a data-href=\"Friend\" href=\"player-characters/friend.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Friend</a> both apparently contracted Demonphage, which is actually the name and is ABSOLUTELY BAD. Apparently Click had the same visions we did, so I think we found a new travel buddy! Also, the giant tree stump was like a weird tourist attraction, so we went in to investigate what was going on and hopefully find a way to help clear out this demon dust. The first room had a contract with a quill that were super cool and magic! There was a voice that asked us our names and purposes, and when we answered, the quill wrote our names! I’m pretty sure this place is owned by a silver dragon, which is SO COOL! I MIGHT GET TO MEET A DRAGON! The second room had a table with stories and travel notes, and we figured we needed to leave a token of our travels, so I left the schematics for my Grabby-Claw™, because inventions are meant to be shared with the world (or at least with a COOL DRAGON! Do you think they’ve seen anything like it before? Do you think they’ll think it’s cool??). The third room had a fountain and some statues, but there was a spot for another statue that was empty. Gerda went and stood in that section and GOT TELEPORTED AWAY! I’m not about to leave a party member behind, so Click and I immediately ran to the spot and we got zapped away too! I think Elwing was saying something as we were running there, but I wasn’t really paying attention (sorry, Red!). If I never reappear, tell Steel Jack that I was the one who miscalibrated the turbo-encapsulator on the mechanoflange that one time, I was lying when I said Balthazar bumped it (sorry).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Penelope 3","level":1,"id":"Penelope 3"}],"links":["Cavern Rose","player-characters/gerda.html","player-characters/elwing.html","entities/npcs/click.html","player-characters/friend.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"session-logs/3/penelope-3.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1728221271053,"modifiedTime":1728221385733,"sourceSize":3960,"sourcePath":"Session logs/3/Penelope 3.md","exportPath":"session-logs/3/penelope-3.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["index.html","session-logs/3/archive-3.html"],"type":"markdown"},"session-logs/4/penelope-4.html":{"title":"Penelope 4","icon":"","description":"Penelope’s Super Heroic Adventure Log\nEntry 4\nFlamecrest 2 [adventuring really makes for some long days!]Good news, we didn’t die! I also totally wasn’t responsible for any miscalibrations, it was probably just the stress talking when I wrote that. Yeah. Definitely…The teleporter brought us to some sort of weird staircase that seemed to go up and down for eternity. Apparently <a data-href=\"Gerda\" href=\"player-characters/gerda.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Gerda</a> heard some weird voice that asked her up or down and if we were with her (side note: she said yes! I knew she cared about us). We were standing on a landing with a dwarven statue of some kind of knight. The crafting was intricate, but also seemed really old [I know, I know, magic teleportation, probable dragon, OF COURSE the crafting was old and intricate, but I was always told to be specific in my notes]. There was also a room off the landing with another statue on some sort of rails that were broken. The tracks were also, apparently, made broken, which is kinda weird, but I guess this was some sort of test of character, so maybe that makes sense? We had to push the statue to the other end of the track while not being annoyed that we were being zapped by little lightning balls. <a data-href=\"Friend\" href=\"player-characters/friend.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Friend</a> seemed to get the worst of it, but they also seemed to get by all right.Once we had moved the statue on the cart, the one on the landing had changed position (which apparently some of the others heard, but it’s not my fault all the time in the shop damaged my hearing). It was holding out a silver key for us, which Gerda took, and we headed up to the next landing.The second landing was a lot like the first, another statue, this time of an angelic figure who seemed to be in distress. There was a word on it “charity” and another offshoot room, but this time it was like an entire campsite that was being buffeted by a storm. There was an aasimar woman in there who seemed in bad shape, so the Dream Team™ set about helping her. I patched the tend while Gerda dried her clothes, <a data-href=\"Elwing\" href=\"player-characters/elwing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Elwing</a> made an antidote for the poison that was hurting her, and Friend hid in a pond. Oh right, Friend also gave her a brand-new shovel (which it called a “Wand of Digging” though I don’t think it was magical…). <a data-href=\"Click\" href=\"entities/npcs/click.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Click</a> even helped out by grabbing kindling for the fire! When we finished, the storm seemed to stop and the fire lit. I’m glad we could help out, even if she was apparently just an illusion.After helping the woman at the campsite, the angelic statue seemed to be doing better, and also had a silver key for us. Gerda grabbed the second key and we went upstairs to the next floor. This one had a statue of a dragon on the landing, and a warning to “outcast or outlast.” I tried to outcast, but apparently cantrips don’t really impress a dragon. On the offshoot room, there were some portals drawn onto the floor, that summoned these weird one-eyed monsters that seemed to read our scariest memory. I… wasn’t brave. Adventurers are supposed to be, right? They’re supposed to look death right in the eye and make it blink. I… just froze. I guess that means I need to get stronger. Thankfully the monsters weren’t around long, they disappeared back to wherever they were summoned from, and we got a third key from the dragon statue.This time when we went up the stairs, we found a door made of silver with three keyholes, which is probably not a coincidence. Hopefully we’ll meet this dragon who made all of this, and get an explanation of what’s going on here.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Penelope 4","level":1,"id":"Penelope 4"}],"links":["player-characters/gerda.html","player-characters/friend.html","player-characters/elwing.html","entities/npcs/click.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"session-logs/4/penelope-4.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1728251565187,"modifiedTime":1728256010873,"sourceSize":3507,"sourcePath":"Session logs/4/Penelope 4.md","exportPath":"session-logs/4/penelope-4.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"terms-and-phrases/days-of-the-week.html":{"title":"Days of the week","icon":"","description":"Each month has 3 weeks and 30 days, with ten days per week\nArbor Belter Cantor Fretless Greenwave Loresun Ternstay Windwill Veilnor Yarnallow\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Days of the week","level":1,"id":"Days of the week"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"terms-and-phrases/days-of-the-week.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724293629553,"modifiedTime":1724293643660,"sourceSize":173,"sourcePath":"Terms and Phrases/Days of the week.md","exportPath":"terms-and-phrases/days-of-the-week.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"terms-and-phrases/month-names.html":{"title":"Month names","icon":"","description":"\nSproutsurge Dewfall Bloomwave Flamecrest Highsun Shadeveil Mirthwind Galesong Windfellow Breezemist Lumis Chillglow\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Month names","level":1,"id":"Month names"},{"heading":"Spring","level":6,"id":"*Spring*"},{"heading":"Summer","level":6,"id":"*Summer*"},{"heading":"Autumn","level":6,"id":"*Autumn*"},{"heading":"Winter","level":6,"id":"*Winter*"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"terms-and-phrases/month-names.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724293576230,"modifiedTime":1724293590782,"sourceSize":217,"sourcePath":"Terms and Phrases/Month names.md","exportPath":"terms-and-phrases/month-names.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"terms-and-phrases/races-&-lifespans-of-most-races.html":{"title":"Races & Lifespans of most races","icon":"","description":"\nAasimar &amp; Tieflings: 150-200 Beastfolk: 100-200 (includes aarakocra, kenku, owlin, shifters, tabaxi) Dragonkind: 80-300 (includes dragonborn, kobolds, lizardfolk, tortle, and yuan ti) Dwarves: 300-400 Elves: 600-700 Fey races 100-300 (includes changlings, centaurs, fairies, harengone, minotaur, satyr) Genasi: 150-300 Giantkin: 200-500 (includes firbolg and goliath) Gnomes: 600-700 Goblinkind: 50-200 (includes bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins) Half-elves: 150-250 Half-orcs: 100-200 Halflings: 100-300 Orcs: 100-300 Triton: 150-300\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Races & Lifespans of most races","level":1,"id":"Races & Lifespans of most races"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"terms-and-phrases/races-&-lifespans-of-most-races.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724330655987,"modifiedTime":1724330723029,"sourceSize":579,"sourcePath":"Terms and Phrases/Races & Lifespans of most races.md","exportPath":"terms-and-phrases/races-&-lifespans-of-most-races.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"index.html":{"title":"Index","icon":"","description":"Cards Cards Between five and thirty years ago (depending on what plane you're from) there was a massive arcane cataclysm called the <a data-href=\"Spellplague\" href=\"Spellplague\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Spellplague</a> that caused all magic to stop functioning.
